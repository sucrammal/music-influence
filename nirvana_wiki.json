Founded by lead singer and guitarist [[Kurt Cobain]] and bassist [[Krist Novoselic]], the band went through a succession of drummers, most notably [[Chad Channing]], before recruiting [[Dave Grohl]] in 1990. Nirvana's success popularized [[alternative rock]], and they were often referenced as the figurehead band of [[Generation X]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-09-17 |title=Nivrana: A Tribute to Nirvana, September 27 |url=https://www.rcreader.com/music/nivrana-nirvana-tribute-redstone-room-sep27 |access-date=2025-01-06 |website=www.rcreader.com |language=en}}</ref> Their music maintains a popular following and continues to influence rock culture.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Nirvana established itself as part of the Seattle [[grunge]] scene. They released their first album, ''[[Bleach (Nirvana album)|Bleach]]'', for the independent record label [[Sub Pop]] in 1989. Their sound relied on dynamic contrasts, often between quiet verses and loud, heavy choruses. After signing to the major label [[DGC Records]] in 1990, Nirvana found unexpected mainstream success with \"[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]\", the first single from its landmark second album, ''[[Nevermind]]'' (1991). A cultural phenomenon of the 1990s, ''Nevermind'' was certified [[RIAA certification|13\u00d7 Platinum]] in the US and is credited for ending the popularity of [[hair metal]].<ref name=\"auto2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/12/nirvana-kill-hair-metal|title=Nirvana kill hair metal|first=Keith|last=Cameron|work=The Guardian |date=June 11, 2011|accessdate=February 23, 2025}}</ref><ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite web|url=https://loudwire.com/grunge-killed-ended-hair-metal/|title=How Grunge Killed Hair Metal|first=Lauryn|last=Schaffner|date=June 14, 2019|website=Loudwire|accessdate=February 23, 2025}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/myth-grunge-killed-hair-metal/|title=Dispelling the myth that grunge killed hair metal|date=January 10, 2022|website=faroutmagazine.co.uk|accessdate=February 23, 2025}}</ref>\n\nCharacterized by a [[Punk subculture|punk]] aesthetic, Nirvana's fusion of [[Pop music|pop]] melodies with [[Noise music|noise]], combined with its themes of [[abjection]] and [[social alienation]], brought them global popularity. Following extensive touring and the 1992 compilation album ''[[Incesticide]]'' and [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[Hormoaning]]'', the band released its highly anticipated third studio album, ''[[In Utero]]'' (1993). The album topped both the US and UK album charts, and was acclaimed by critics. Nirvana disbanded following [[Suicide of Kurt Cobain|Cobain's suicide]] in April 1994. Further releases have been overseen by Novoselic, Grohl, and Cobain's widow, [[Courtney Love]]. The live album ''[[MTV Unplugged in New York]]'' (1994) won [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album|Best Alternative Music Performance]] at the [[1996 Grammy Awards]].\n\nNirvana is one of [[list of best-selling music artists|the best-selling bands]] of all time, having sold more than 75&nbsp;million records worldwide, including certified sales of 60 million in the US.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Gold & Platinum |url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/ |access-date=2025-10-30 |website=RIAA |language=en-US}}</ref> During its three years as a mainstream act, Nirvana received an [[American Music Awards|American Music Award]], [[Brit Awards|Brit Award]], and [[Grammy Award]], as well as seven [[MTV Video Music Award]]s and two [[NME Awards]].

Cobain would often initially play a song's verse riff in a clean tone, then double it with distorted guitars when he repeated the part. In some verses, the guitar would be absent to allow the drums and bass guitar to support the vocals, or it would only play sparse melodies like the two-note pattern used in \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\". Cobain rarely played standard guitar solos, opting to play variations of the song's melody as single-note lines. Cobain's solos were mostly blues-based and discordant, which music writer Jon Chappell described as \"almost an iconoclastic parody of the traditional instrumental break\", a quality typified by the note-for-note replication of the lead melody in \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" and the atonal solo for \"Breed\".<ref name=\"Chappel\">Chappell, Jon. \"Nirvana's music\".

They began tuning down either a half step or full step as well as concert pitch. Sometimes all three tunings would be in the same show. By the summer of that year, the band had settled on the half step down tuning ([[Guitar tunings#E\u266d tuning|E\u266d]]).<ref name=\"requiem\">Cross, Charles R. \"Requiem for a Dream\".

In comparison, Cobain stated that the lyrics to ''In Utero'' were \"more focused, they're almost built on themes\".<ref name=\"steinke\" /> Cobain did not write in a linear fashion, instead relying on juxtapositions of contradictory images to convey emotions and ideas. Often in his lyrics, Cobain would present an idea then reject it; he said, \"I'm such a nihilistic jerk half the time and other times I'm so vulnerable and sincere [.. The songs are] like a mixture of both of them.
